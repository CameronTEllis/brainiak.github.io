Ready to learn BrainIAK? You have come to the right spot. We have tutorials that will cover materials 
from the basics of Machine Learning to advanced MVPA techniques. They are all done in Jupyter notebooks.
These materials are currently (Spring 2018) being used for a course at Yale Univerity.

If you are new to python we highly recommend learning the materials in Chapter 1 before moving on to more advanced
analysis.
